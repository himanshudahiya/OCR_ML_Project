Download the dataset of MNIST and notMNIST from: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Si0NONhCWaetQq4lbNwXWBRJwYy0mxKx?usp=sharing

Create a new directory 'Dataset' and put these datasets in this directory.

Make sure 'Dataset' folder is in Project Folder.

============================================================================================================================================

The project is based on MATLAB. There are various scripts.

For kNN:
1. Run kNN_MNIST.m to test upon MNIST dataset.
2. Run kNN_notMNIST.m to test upon notMNIST dataset.

For L2 Logistic Regression:
1. Run L2LogisticRegression_MNIST.m to test upon MNIST dataset.
2. Run L2LogisticRegression_notMNIST.m to test upon notMNIST dataset.

For SVM:
1. Go into SVM folder. All the scripts and functions related to SVM are in SVM folder only.
2. Run MainSVMTrainTest_MNIST.m to test upon MNIST dataset.
3. Run MainSVMTrainTest_notMNIST.m to test upon notMNIST dataset.

Outputs will be displayed after the execution completes in each case. The error/accuracy shown for each model is for test data only. 

============================================================================================================================================

To change input size of training and testing dataset in MNIST, open scripts related to MNIST dataset, and set the value of following variables:
1. numberoftrainingexamples for setting size of training examples. Default is set to 15000. Maximum value can be 60000.
2. numberoftestingexamples for setting size of testing examples. Default is set to 3000. Maximum value can be 10000.

============================================================================================================================================

To change division ratio of training and testing dataset in notMNIST, open scripts related to notMNIST dataset, and set the value of following variables:
1. ratio for setting size of ratio in which training and testing are to be divided. Default is set to .80 which means 80% training data and 20% testing data.
